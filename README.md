serial CLI commands:
move <options> angle : turn joints corresponding angle (ex: move -a 10 -b 20 -c 30 -d 40)
moveto <options> angle :move joints to corresponding angle (ex: moveto -a 10 -b 20 -c 30 -d 40)
position: get current angles of each joint

if you use arduino IDE:
copy all files from folders src and include into a folder name "main", open main.cpp with arduino ide and compile
